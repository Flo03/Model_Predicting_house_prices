# Machine Learning Project: Predicting house prices

Welcome to this machine-learning project repository! I  build a predictive model to tackle a real-world challenge which is predicting prices of features houses based on certain features. Follow along as we load and preprocess data, explore insights, and fine-tune our model for accurate predictions.
